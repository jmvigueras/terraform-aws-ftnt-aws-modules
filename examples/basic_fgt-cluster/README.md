# Example: Forigate deployment

This is an example of how to deploy fortigates using [ftnt-aws-modules](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/jmvigueras/ftnt-aws-modules/aws/latest)

You can choose type of cluster to deploy, number of AZs to deploy and number of FortiGate cluster members.

> [!NOTE]
> FGCP cluster has two members only and can be deployed in 1 or 2 AZs
> FGSP cluster can have up to 16 members, recommended no more than 8 and can be split in several AZs.
